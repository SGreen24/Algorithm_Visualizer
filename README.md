# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

**Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive tool that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in real time using the Pygame library. This project provides a hands-on way to see how different sorting techniques work, how they manipulate data, and how their performance varies depending on the input. The application visually represents each step in the sorting process, highlighting the comparisons and swaps that occur in real time.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Supports six popular sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Selection Sort
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the sorting process unfold visually as each algorithm sorts the data step by step.
- **User Interaction**: Choose the sorting algorithm, reset the data, and toggle between ascending or descending order via keyboard controls.
- **Customizable Data**: Randomly generates a list of values for sorting, ensuring each run is different.

## Controls
* R: Reset the list with new random values.
* Space: Start sorting with the selected algorithm.
* A: Set sorting order to Ascending.
* D: Set sorting order to Descending.


## Sorting Algorithms
* I: Insertion Sort
* S: Selection Sort
* B: Bubble Sort
* M: Merge Sort
* Q: Quick Sort
* H: Heap Sort


## How to Run
1. git clone this repo
2. pip install pygame
